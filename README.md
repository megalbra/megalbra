Hi! I am Mary Galbraith! I am an a-typical student who earned my B.S. in Chemical Engineering in 2019 and went into industry, but now I'm back to broaden my skills now as a future software engineer!
I'm interested in Unity for game devopment, and general Java code-writing to learn the language.
I'm learning Java in school and Javascript and Node.js in self-study.
